# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About This Repository

This repository contains my practical work for [CP1404 - Programming II](https://github.com/CP1404/CP1404Practicals), a subject at James Cook University that focuses on object-oriented programming, clean code practices, and software development techniques using Python.

My name is **[Eka]** and I'm a student learning to write clean, maintainable, and efficient Python code. This repository showcases my weekly practicals, problem-solving approaches, and understanding of key software design principles.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned

Throughout this subject, I have learned many valuable practices about writing clean code, including:

- **Meaningful naming**: Variables, functions, and classes should have descriptive names that reveal intent and improve readability.
- **Small, focused functions**: Functions should do one thing and do it well. Breaking down tasks into smaller pieces helps reduce complexity.
- **Consistent formatting**: Code should be consistently formatted using proper indentation, spacing, and structure to make it easier to read and maintain.

These practices have significantly improved the clarity and quality of my code.
