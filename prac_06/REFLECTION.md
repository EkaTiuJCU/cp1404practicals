# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started planning my code more carefully before writing it, such as thinking through logic 
and writing small test examples. I now use functions and classes more consistently, and I’m focusing 
more on understanding how things work rather than just making them work.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to manage my time better. I often leave practical tasks too late or rush through them. I want to 
improve by starting earlier and spending more time revising or testing my work to avoid last-minute pressure and 
mistakes.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am following instructions carefully, seeking help when needed, and trying to understand the purpose behind each task. 
I'm also consistently committing my code and using version control properly, which helps track my progress

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop relying on just “trial and error” and instead read error messages more carefully and learn from them. 
I should also focus more on writing clean, readable code rather than just functional code.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would appreciate more real-world examples or small mini-projects that apply the skills we’ve learned. Sometimes the 
tasks feel a bit disconnected, so applying them in a bigger context would help solidify the concepts.
